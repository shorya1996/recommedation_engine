When providing the scan, I must identify the country of issue of the ID. Note - this scan is mandatory for candidates using an ID in a non-romanised language (e.g. Chinese) Select a location from an intuitive menu or list I can browse locations by drilling down through country, state and city. I will only be shown locations that I am eligible to use given my current eligibilities I may filter locations based on certain criteria (e.g. hours of operation, keyboard type) Choose the location to schedule an exam If the location is one that must be scheduled by an external vendor, I will be alerted and redirected to the vendor's scheduling site (possibly just a clickable URL). Optional: my redhat.com credentials permit single sign-on to the external vendor's site If the location can be scheduled in the scheduler, I can proceed to the scheduling process See location specific details including the street address, operating hours and any location specific details (e.g. the keyboard layout of the RHIE systems) Select an exam to schedule from an intuitive menu or list If I am eligible to schedule the exam, I can proceed with the process If I am not eligible to schedule the exam, I am informed that I am not eligible and provided contact information and a list of exams for which I have eligibility records With a location and exam selected, I can specify a date and see available time slots for that date Scheduling will take into account variables such as setup time for the exam, other candidates' exams and their setup times, pad time between exams to account for the unexpected, plus the operating hours for the location I can specify a range of dates up to a week and see available time slots The presence of multiple RHIE systems in a location will be transparent to me while scheduling Select an available time for my exam and reserve it I can only schedule exam dates within the effective period of my eligibility record; attempting to schedule outside of the effective period will raise an alert with details of my eligibility record I can schedule exams up to 2Education hours in advance but no closer to the specified time If the location has been designated as requiring a scanned ID, I will be warned that I may need to upload a scan of my government issued photo ID if I have not already done so. Upon reserving the time, I will receive an email notification of the reservation including site specific information such as the street address and the keyboard type. If the location has been designated as requiring a scanned ID, this email will include a warning that I must present exactly the same ID as has been uploaded and a prompt to upload my ID if I haven't already done so. My notification will designate a particular RHIE system ID for the location; in most cases, a location may only have one RHIE system but in some situations there may be multiple RHIE systems View comprehensive information regarding my exams and eligibility records View my available eligibility records including the exams I am eligible to schedule and the effective period of the eligibility record",candidate
